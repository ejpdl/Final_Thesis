                    Welcome to the Digital Portfolio for Grade 7 Students (the “Platform”).

                </p>    

                <h5> 1. Use of Platform </h5>
                <p>

                    Users agree not to misuse the Platform, including attempting to access data or accounts not authorized for their use.
                    Users must respect the privacy and confidentiality of others by not sharing any information or files outside the Platform without explicit consent.
                </p>

                <h5> 6. Limitation of Liability </h5>
